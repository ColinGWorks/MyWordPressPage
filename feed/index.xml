<p>Now it is 2019, and it gets pretty easy with setting up a web page  managed by WordPress, hosted on highly available servers with minimum cost. On Mar 1st, Google has released the <em>.dev </em>TLD (top level domain). Hence I found this <em>www.devwave.dev</em> domain name for my use, of course with a small amount of registration fee.</p>



<p>Here is a brief history of the <em>.dev</em> domain names.  All TLD names such as <em>.com</em>, <em>.edu</em> are managed by organization named ICANN. At around 2009, it decided to open up TLDs to any name, as long as a determined register fee is paid. Thus, <em>.engineering</em>, <em>.news</em>, <em>.app</em>, and <em>.club</em>, all these novel names have become TLDs.  And Google has applied to own the TLDs such as <em>.dev</em> and <em>.chrome</em>. Previously, developers have been using .dev domain as alias to localhost domain, and use it, for example <em>www.standard.dev,</em> as URL for testing locally hosted web services.  After Google become the owner of <em>.dev</em> TLD and now release them for public use, this practice has recently become outdated. But still, Google intends public to register .dev domain names for hosting web sites that are dedicated to development and technology.</p>
